// 💌 LETTER CONTENT (WITH FORMATTING)
const letterContent = `Swara, my dear Rasmalai ❤️,

I made all this for you. ✨ Just so that I could see you smile. 🥺 But sadly, I'm not there to see it right now. 😞 But don't worry. I'll be with you someday... One day ❤️

I know sometimes you might feel that I don't love you, or that I love you less. But that's not true at all. 🥺❤️

I love you more than words can express. 💘 More than the stars ⭐ love the night sky 🌃🌙. More than the ocean 🌊🪸 loves the shore ⛱️🏖️.

If you think I'll leave you, I'll never ever leave you. 😤 No matter what happens, I'll always be by your side, loving you with all my heart. 🥰 Actually, you're stuck with me. 😅😘❤️✨

Every moment with you feels like a dream. Because it's just SO perfect. 😭 

Your smile is my most favorite thing in this world.😍🥺😭✨❤️💘
(Yes even more favorite than your so hot waist 👉🏻👈🏻😩😘😋)

Sometimes I don't always find the perfect words in the moment, but I hope this little surprise shows how much you actually mean to me. 🥺🥰

You just EXIST and my world lights up. 💫 
I feel happy. I think about you randomly throughout the day and it makes me smile.

You inspire me to be better, to love deeper, and to believe in the magic of us. I really believe we'll be together one day. And I WILL make it happen one day ❤️ 

If some small things, like this, make you smile, make you happy, then I want to do them for you. Always. 🥺❤️✨
Will you let me have the privilege to do all these things for my pretty princess? 🥺❤️

Yes I'm possessive and jealous sometimes 🔥, but it's only because I care about you so much ❤️‍🩹. I want to protect you from any hurt. 🥺❤️
I want to be your safe place, your home, your everything. 🏠
I hope this little letter 💌 brings a smile to your face and warmth to your heart. Because you deserve all the happiness in the world. 😌

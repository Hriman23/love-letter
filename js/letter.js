// 💌 LETTER CONTENT (WITH FORMATTING)
const letterContent = `Swara, my dear Rasmalai,
I made all this for you. Just so that I could see you smile. But sadly, I'm not there to see it right now.
I know sometimes you might feel that I don't love you, or that I love you less. But that's not true at all. 
I love you more than words can express. More than the stars love the night sky. More than the ocean loves the shore.
I'll never ever leave you. No matter what happens, I'll always be by your side, loving you with all my heart.
Every moment with you feels like a dream. Your smile is my most favorite thing in this world. (Yes even more favorite than your so hot waist 👉🏻👈🏻)
Sometimes I don't always find the perfect words in the moment, but I hope this little surprise shows how much you mean to me
You just EXIST and my world lights up. I feel happy. I think about you randomly throughout the day and it makes me smile.
You inspire me to be better, love deeper, and believe in the magic of us. I believe we'll be together one day.
If some small things make you smile, make you happy, then I want to do them for you. Always.
Yes I'm possessive and jealous sometimes, but it's only because I care about you so much. I want to protect you from any hurt.
I want to be your safe place, your home, your everything.
I hope this little letter brings a smile to your face and warmth to your heart. Because you deserve all the happiness in the world.

To my dearest Swara,
You are my forever,
my reason to smile,
my heart's desire,
my one and only,
my desire to love,
my endless joy,
my sweetest dream,
my everything,
my Rasmalai.

Forever yours,
Your silly Batman
